Section 1: Defining, Implementing, and Importing Packages
1.	Create a Java package utilities that contains a class MathUtils with a method add(int a, int b) to return the sum of two numbers. Demonstrate the use of this package in another class.
2.	Define a package shapes containing an interface Shape with methods double area() and double perimeter(). Implement the interface in classes Circle and Rectangle.
3.	Write a program to import classes from java.util and use ArrayList to store and display a list of integers.


Section 2: Interfaces
Functional Interface and Lambda Expression
4.	Define a functional interface Calculator with a method int compute(int a, int b). Use a lambda expression to provide implementation for addition, subtraction, and multiplication.
5.	Write a Java program to sort a list of strings in descending order using a lambda expression.
6.	Implement a method reference in a program to find the square of a number using a static method.


Section 3: Errors and Exceptions
Exception Handling
7.	Write a program that demonstrates the difference between try-catch and try-catch-finally blocks by dividing two numbers and handling ArithmeticException.
8.	Create a custom exception InvalidAgeException that is thrown when a user's age is less than 18. Write a program to demonstrate its use.
Built-in and Custom Exceptions
9.	Create a custom exception InvalidAgeException that is thrown when a user's age is less than 18. Handle the exception and log the error to a file using java.util.logging.
10.	Demonstrate the use of throw and throws keywords in a program that calculates the factorial of a number. Throw an exception if the input number is negative.
